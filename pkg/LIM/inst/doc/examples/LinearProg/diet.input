Dietary optimization (Maximum Calories and Minimal Cost)
There are six different foods: Bread, Milk, Cheese, Fish, Potato and Yogurt:

## COMP
  Bread
  Milk
  Cheese
  Potato
  Fish
  Yogurt
## END COMP

each of these foods has a certain cost, in $
a certain protein, fat and carbohydrate, calory content

### END PARAMETERS

We have to find a diet that contains not less than 150 calories,
not more than 10 g of protein,
not less than 10 g of carbohydrates and not less than 8 g of fat.
In addition the diet should include at least 0.5 g of fish and not more than 1 cups of milk.

## CONSTRAINTS
Bread *CalBread +Milk  *CalMilk + Cheese*CalCheese + Potato*CalPotato   &
+ Fish  *CalFish  + Yogurt*CalYogurt  > 150

Bread *ProtBread +Milk  *ProtMilk + Cheese*ProtCheese + Potato*ProtPotato   &
+ Fish  *ProtFish  + Yogurt*ProtYogurt  < 10

Bread *CarboBread +Milk  *CarboMilk + Cheese*CarboCheese + Potato*CarboPotato   &
+ Fish  *CarboFish  + Yogurt*CarboYogurt  > 10

Bread *FatBread +Milk  *FatMilk + Cheese*FatCheese + Potato*FatPotato   &
+ Fish  *FatFish  + Yogurt*FatYogurt  > 8

Fish > 0.5
milk < 1


## END CONSTRAINTS

Also, the diet should have minimal cost.



## COST
Bread *CostBread +Milk  *CostMilk + Cheese*CostCheese + Potato*CostPotato   &
+ Fish  *CostFish  + Yogurt*CostYogurt
## END COST


!The problem has been solved successfully with the following diet: Milk 0.564 cups
!Cheese 0.185 g
!Potato 0.147 g
!Fish 0.5 g

!Bread and Yogurt are excluded from the diet.

!The Total Cost is $9.17
