\title{
  Generates a random sample of the unknowns for a linear inverse problem
}
\description{
  Given an inverse input list, randomly samples the unknowns,
  using an MCMC method
}

\usage{
Xsample(lim, exact=NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{lim }{a list that contains the linear inverse model
    specification, as  generated by function \code{setup.limfile}.
  }
  \item{exact }{if not \code{NULL}, a vector containing the numbers of
    the equations to be solved exactly; if \code{NULL}, all equations
    are considered exact.
  }
  \item{... }{extra parameters passed to function
    \code{\link[limSolve]{xsample}} from package\code{limSolve}.
  }
}
\value{
  a 2-columned vector containing the minimum (column 1) and
  maximum (column 2) of each unknown.
}

\examples{# sample solution space
  xs <- Xsample(LIMRigaAutumn,iter=500,jmp=5)
  # remove flows that are invariable (sd=0)
  xs <- xs[,-which(sd(xs)==0)]

\details{
  For overdetermined LIM problems, the inverse equations may be split up
  in equations which have to be exactly met and other equations which have
  to be approximated.

  \code{exact} is a vector with the exact equations
 
  The default settings of \code{xsample} will often not do.
  For instance, the default consists of 3000 iterations (\code{iter}) and
  a jump length of \code{jmp} of 0.1.
  You may need to increase one of those to ensure that the
  entire solution space has been adequately sampled.
